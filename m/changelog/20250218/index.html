					<h1>2025.02.18 - Website Changelog</h1>
					<p>
						okay. we are really ramping things up here. we're getting more transparent. going to be publishing some more from the archives.
						or just putting it out into the public archives. it's going to be great, more than it ever has been. establishing a base.
						need to establish a schedule. once a week. weekly everything. still struggling with the quality control.
						got to ignore it if we're going to keep any momentum. never cared before. not in the same way. 2-0-2-5 should be wake up year.
						every year should be wake-up year. happy wake-up day. expecting feedback, dreading it.
						got to stop caring to a certain extent, so we can get things done. maybe bring back some old things in new light.
						new angles. old things are taking up most of the resouces right now. probably better to get them all neatly wrapped and shelved.
						keep making new things. once the old things are finalized, we can do anything. need to do one thing at a time.
						need to standardize things in a good way. making progress. things are already better than they were this time last year.
						got to simplify. organize everything we have and take a step back, re-evaluate. that's the way to do it. get to it.
						should've started sooner, still pretty early. good job. if we keep this up, we can make something meaningful out of it.
					</p>
					<p>
						should notes be journal
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>yes</li>
						<li>nope</li>
						<li>who cares - 90%</li>
					</ul>
					<p>notes, scrap, other, journal</p>
					<p>can't distinguish between them</p>
					<p>	
						Good morning. I've wiped from existence so many files - videos, writing, songs, code - because I was stupid.
						That's why we have a big chronological timeline of everything that survived and will everything that will survive far into the future, and that's why we're doing weekly backups of everything.
					</p>
					<p>Okay, back to structure:</p>
					<p>We have Directory, we have category pages:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>/t/ (tech)</li>
						<li>/w/ (writing)</li>
						<li>/m/ (meta)</li>
						<li>/i/ (images)</li>
						<li>/s/ (sounds/music)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The focus is writing today. It looks like this:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>/index.html</li>
						<li>/scrap/</li>
						<li>/notes/</li>
						<li>/other/</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Wondering if notes should be 'journal'.<br>
						<b>Yes</b>: because it has journal-like entries<br>
						<b>No</b>: because we're already putting website-related journal entries as... sub-entries within the website changelog.<br>
						Should notes be 'journal'? no.<br>
						Should we have 'journal' alongside notes? I don't know.
					</p>
					<p>the process should (could) be this:</p>
					<p>
						is it 'creative'? (how do we determine that?) (that's 'other' for now)<br>
						 yes: put it in /w/other/<br>
						 no: next<br>
						is it a note? (short matter-of-fact thing, status update, something like that, something that isn't necessarily a website changelog entry)<br>
						 yes: put it in /w/notes/<br>
						 no: next<br>
						is it a website changelog entry? (a journal-like 'sub-entry' for the website changelog)<br>
						 yes: put it in /m/changelog/<br>
						 no: put it in /w/scrap/
					</p>
					<p>something like that. it's pretty simple really, well, it should be. but differentiating between all these entries can be a pain.</p>
					<p>here's a better one:</p>
					<p>
						is it 'creative'? ('other')<br>
						 yes: is it 'finished' & non-'note' & 'a longer entry':<br>
							yes: put it in /w/other/<br>
							no: next<br>
						is it 'journal-like'?<br>
						 yes: is it a 'website changelog entry'?<br>
							yes: put it in /w/changelog/<br>
							no: do we want it public?<br>
							 yes: put it in /w/notes/<br>
							 no: forget it<br>
						repeat for every single slice of a journal entry. best to do it now before things really pile up.
					</p>
					<h2>potential problems:</h2>
					<p><b>with having a scrap page</b>: you want to just put everything on the scrap page</p>
					<p><b>with not having a scrap page</b>: everything that might be awful (which could be everything) is mixed in with everything that could be fantastic, which could also be everything, or most things, but probably isn't either.</p>
					<p><b>with having a scrap page</b>: allows us to actually publish things, share ideas, 'who cares'</p>
					<h2>conclusion</h2>
					<p>Obviously we need to stop erasing things, because I don't even remember half the things that I've erased, that feels like a loss, waste of time. I even made a bunch of 'songs' that I just completely erased, and now I can't remember what they were. So keep sharing the garbage. But constantly re-evaluate it. Not too much because we need to actually get things done. It's a balancing act.</p>
					<p>So, we have writing, we have drawings, we have sounds/music things, we have photos, we have code. We don't really have video yet, which seems like the obvious step up. But maybe not yet. But we will need an alternate container for everything combined, clearly. But we have to keep building first. And it can't be a 'hoarders house' of stuff, where it just piles up and falls on me. It has to be organized, compressed, but still easily accessible.</p>
					<p>THE GOAL</p>
					<p>is to just make things and then document them. Repeat. Forever. Obviously there will be some variation.</p>
					<p>trust the process</p>
					<p>thinking about 'soundcloud' for my 'music'. don't know if it's soundcloud-worthy, but it is a better, more direct option than mediafire, which requires people actually download the file. bandcamp is another option. the problem is that i am *not* a musician/artist. i don't play anything. i should. i just happen to have many things that i want to share and index publically, including music/art. bandcamp is another option.</p>
					<p>bandcamp is the best option. going to use that instead.</p>
					<p><b>https://callumfisher.bandcamp.com/track/calm-waters</b></p>
					<p>is clearly better than</p>
					<p><b>https://www.mediafire.com/file/wdyegc2zf72jnwe/Calm_Waters.flac/file</b></p>
					<p>and you can listen directly through bandcamp. that's the way to do it. for now.</p>
					<p>okay, bandcamp is set up. will need to replace audio with new versions. reduce cut-offs, etc. need to do some quality control. here's when quality control is actually a good thing. the good news is that we can replace files later. bad news is i have no idea when that will happen, if ever. the other good news is that we can finally have things not waiting forever. uploaded 'calm waters'. will need to make a cover of some description, because the photo (birds) feels overused at this point. could be a good excuse to try 'artwork' again. should be fun. haven't done that for a while.  don't know what resolution. 500x500? sounds good, maybe. 1000x1000? don't know. so here's where we are: we're at progress street, and we're walking down at a leisurely pace, and we're probably going somewhere. we're already somewhere, but we're also in-between destinations we'd like to reach. i could talk about structure and refinement for the rest of my life or i could just get things done. on that note,</p>
					<p>(just call it 'the big dump')</p>
					<p>also, need to list changelog entries on the all page.</p>
					<p>
						take everything you've got<br>
						put it into a big mixing pot
					</p>
					<p>oh and include the dreams, the dreams have gotta go somewhere. oh and that sketchup stuff. that could go there. i forgot about that.</p>
					<p>the bandcamp thing could really be a good catalyst for getting some visual stuff done.</p>
					<p>then the scratch stuff. it's listed, not linked to anything. got to look into making some of that accessible.</p>
					<p>
						dream factory<br>
						nothing center
					</p>
					<h2>SCHEDULE</h2>
					<p>OKAY</p>
					<p>
						let's say this: every saturday, we push any pending website changes. don't know if i said that already, but that's it. final
					</p>
					<p>So, maybe the writing section should be in a 'finalized' state by Saturday, all neat and tidy, and indexed. ready for the party. then we can dismantle and clean everything again, get it ready for the next party on saturday. maybe with another big feature. so every week is different.</p>
