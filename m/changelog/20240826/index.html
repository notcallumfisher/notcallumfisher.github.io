					<h1>2024.08.26 - Website Changelog</h1>
					<p>
						My navbar isn't necessarily the same on every page, since each page is uniquely created,
						that would mean a lot more maintenance if links/navbar button names were ever updated.
						Instead, I keep a consistent "Directory" button on the left hand side of every single page's navbar,
						and then I leave the right side for contextual buttons specific to that page. For example, the homepage (Directory) has the Search and About buttons,
						two things that you may want immediate access to on a homepage.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the category pages (E.G. Software), I still have an About button but also link back to the Directory on the left side of the navbar.
						In article pages (E.G. Software/article-about-computers), I have a Directory button (left) and a "More on Software" button (right) that links back to the Software category page. The category pages act as sub-Directories of the main Directory page.
						This means that if a user enters the website via an article, they can quickly reach the Directory, or they can see "More on Software" and see the latest Software articles and the About page.
						It's not perfect, but it's a good balance between consistency and ease of maintenance for me, given that it's a static website.
					</p>
					<p>
						I set up Pagefind, a client-side search index, so users can search from the homepage for content across all the website's pages.
						I also set the 404 page to display a search box that automatically searches for the URL path content.
						This means that if a user tries to mywebsite.com/page-that-does-not-exist, the 404 error page will search for "page-does-not-exist"
						in an attempt to display some relevant content.
						This is ideal for situations where outdated hyperlinks reference delete or renamed pages (although they shouldn't).
						If somebody visits "mywebsite.com/articleAboutCheese" after it was renamed to "anArticleAboutCheese",
						it will display in the search results of the 404 page.
