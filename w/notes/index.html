						<p>Pagespeed Insights is a great tool from Google, but it's strange to me that YouTube - being a Google-owned website - fails the pagespeed tests. It's still a very useful guide.</p>

						<h3>bandcamp vs soundcloud</h3>
						<p>
							Hi. So I set up Bandcamp <a href="../../m/changelog/20250218/index.html">yesterday</a>. I was going to put more things on it today, now it's gone. Deleted. For some reason. I have no idea why. Maybe I violated TOS by uploading such bad 'music' on there. I don't know. I only put one thing on there and now the page is just... gone. And I can't login. So that's a shame. I guess I'll have to try making a new account, see what happens to that one, and then try out Soundcloud if it happens again.
						</p>
						<p>Just searched to see if anybody else has had this issue, seems like there are lot of posts about the same thing. And Bandcamp didn't respond to their e-mails. So that's encouraging.</p>
						<p>I tried to make a new account - it just says "Unknown error" under the password form. Even tried another e-mail address. Guess I'll try Soundcloud instead.</p>
						<p>Okay, so we have: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/">https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/</a></p>
						<p>It's just for testing.</p>

						<h3>Scanning CD Booklets</h3>
						<p>
							- Max FLAC embedded image size is 16mb (vorbis)<br>
							- For some reason images of 2mb+ seem to break file metadata in Windows<br>
							- Scan at 200 DPI as a max (reduces file size)<br>
							- CD cover is 120mm x 120mm<br>
							- Jewel case 142mm x 125mm
						</p>
						<p>
							It's true. Access to your music is better ensured when you have physical copies of it,
							as opposed to relying on streaming services and online subscriptions.
							CDs are easily more versatile, because you hav<i>e</i>... etc.

						<h3>windows contextual search</h3>
						<p>
							The only feature I really want to be added to Windows is some sort of contextual search. I wish I could just type in "emails about [topic]" or "show me pictures from last Christmas", and have Windows show me files based on the context of my search. I know that this feature has been implemented in many other apps (E.G.: Google Photos), so I'm surprised that it hasn't been implemented already. It doesn't even require internet access to do this, so there shouldn't be any privacy concerns.
						</p>
						<p>
							An old version of the Microsoft Photos app on Windows 10 had a feature where it would identify elements of your photos and tag them, so you could search for things like "Christmas" or "pets". Unfortunately they removed that feature in the Windows 11 version, which really seems like a step back to me. It processed your photos locally and there was no internet connection necessary for that feature to work, which is a novelty these days. I don't know why they removed it.
						</p>
						<p>Anyway, just some of my thoughts on the topic.</p>
