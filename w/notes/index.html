						<h3>Publication Saturday #4</h3>
						<p>Hi. It's 'publication party Saturday.' The 15th. Sound of the Week! #1 goes live today - Well, much later today. Today marks our fourth week on the 'Saturday' schedule. It also marks the first addition beyond 'update the website.' Now we're publishing weekly music posts. I should consider 'writing days' or something mid-week just to ensure that keeps going. Everything would still be published on Saturday, but ready by a certain day. Maybe Wednesday or Thursday for Sound of the Week. Or if we can really write one post a day, maybe we should just get that started.</p>
						<p>We'd have a huge backlog of weekly posts. Or, maybe Sound of the Week is something that should just be written when it needs to be. That is, when I feel like it. As long as there is something for Saturday, it's okay. But I'm going to set a personal goal of writing & finishing one post a day till I build up a decent backlog. Either way, I think relaxing on trying to make everything perfect is helping me out. The original first 'Sound of the Week' post was supposed to go out last week (8th) but it just wasn't gonna happen.</p>

						<h3>Sound of the Week! #1 Thoughts</h3>
						<p>Hi. So, I just wrote the first 'Sound of the Week!' post. Well, first to be published. I've written around five drafts now. None of them feel right. So I just wrote the first thing that came to mind, and that was The The's song 'Slow Emotion Replay.' It's a very short post, very casual. I don't know if its any good - or valuable in any way whatsoever. But if we publish it on publication Saturday (15th), it should give us some momentum. The way I see it is as a juggling act. We can gradually start juggling more & more - adding more to the schedule until it's a full-blown show.</p>
						<p>We started with weekly website updates (Saturday). Now it's time to add 'Sound of the Week!' posts. I've been wanting to write about music in some way since 2022, so this is long overdue. No more waiting. I think earlier entries were trying to keep up some persona of a 'show-like' thing. But it's much easier and more geniune if we just stay honest. At the same time, I don't want to be completely lazy about it. So once again, as with everything, it's a balancing act. A juggling act.</p>

						<h3>pagespeed insights insights</h3>
						<p>Pagespeed Insights is a great tool from Google, but it's strange to me that YouTube - being a Google-owned website - fails the pagespeed tests. It's still a very useful guide.</p>

						<h3>bandcamp vs soundcloud</h3>
						<p>
							Hi. So I set up Bandcamp <a href="../../m/changelog/20250218/index.html">yesterday</a>. I was going to put more things on it today, now it's gone. Deleted. For some reason. I have no idea why. Maybe I violated TOS by uploading such bad 'music' on there. I don't know. I only put one thing on there and now the page is just... gone. And I can't login. So that's a shame. I guess I'll have to try making a new account, see what happens to that one, and then try out Soundcloud if it happens again.
						</p>
						<p>Just searched to see if anybody else has had this issue, seems like there are lot of posts about the same thing. And Bandcamp didn't respond to their e-mails. So that's encouraging.</p>
						<p>I tried to make a new account - it just says "Unknown error" under the password form. Even tried another e-mail address. Guess I'll try Soundcloud instead.</p>
						<p>Okay, so we have: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/">https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/</a></p>
						<p>It's just for testing.</p>

						<p>
							Life can be a constant battle of buying & selling that I'm trying to break out of.
						</p>
						<p>
							Well, here we are in a new month. This month I'm going to open-source some projects. This will be the first step in publishing some of my work again before I eventually get the website out there.

						<h3>Scanning CD Booklets</h3>
						<p>
							- Max FLAC embedded image size is 16mb (vorbis)<br>
							- For some reason images of 2mb+ seem to break file metadata in Windows<br>
							- Scan at 200 DPI as a max (reduces file size)<br>
							- CD cover is 120mm x 120mm<br>
							- Jewel case 142mm x 125mm
						</p>
						<p>
							It's true. Access to your music is better ensured when you have physical copies of it,
							as opposed to relying on streaming services and online subscriptions.
							CDs are easily more versatile, because you hav<i>e</i>... etc.

						<h3>windows contextual search</h3>
						<p>
							The only feature I really want to be added to Windows is some sort of contextual search. I wish I could just type in "emails about [topic]" or "show me pictures from last Christmas", and have Windows show me files based on the context of my search. I know that this feature has been implemented in many other apps (E.G.: Google Photos), so I'm surprised that it hasn't been implemented already. It doesn't even require internet access to do this, so there shouldn't be any privacy concerns.
						</p>
						<p>
							An old version of the Microsoft Photos app on Windows 10 had a feature where it would identify elements of your photos and tag them, so you could search for things like "Christmas" or "pets". Unfortunately they removed that feature in the Windows 11 version, which really seems like a step back to me. It processed your photos locally and there was no internet connection necessary for that feature to work, which is a novelty these days. I don't know why they removed it.
						</p>
						<p>Anyway, just some of my thoughts on the topic.</p>
