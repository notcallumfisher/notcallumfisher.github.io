					<h3>Scanning CD Booklets</h3>
					<p>
						- Max FLAC embedded image size is 16mb (vorbis)<br>
						- For some reason images of 2mb+ seem to break file metadata in Windows<br>
						- Scan at 200 DPI as a max (reduces file size)<br>
						- CD cover is 120mm x 120mm<br>
						- Jewel case 142mm x 125mm

						It's true. Access to your music is better ensured when you have physical copies of it,
						as opposed to relying on streaming services and online subscriptions.
						CDs are easily more versatile, because you hav<i>e</i>... etc.

					<h3>windows contextual search</h3>
					<p>
						The only feature I really want to be added to Windows is some sort of contextual search. I wish I could just type in "emails about [topic]" or "show me pictures from last Christmas", and have Windows show me files based on the context of my search. I know that this feature has been implemented in many other apps (E.G.: Google Photos), so I'm surprised that it hasn't been implemented already. It doesn't even require internet access to do this, so there shouldn't be any privacy concerns.
					</p>
					<p>
						An old version of the Microsoft Photos app on Windows 10 had a feature where it would identify elements of your photos and tag them, so you could search for things like "Christmas" or "pets". Unfortunately they removed that feature in the Windows 11 version, which really seems like a step back to me. It processed your photos locally and there was no internet connection necessary for that feature to work, which is a novelty these days. I don't know why they removed it.
					</p>
					<p>Anyway, just some of my thoughts on the topic.</p>
