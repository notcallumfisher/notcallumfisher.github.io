					<h3>Publication Saturday #4</h3>
					<p>Hi. It's 'publication party Saturday.' The 15th. Sound of the Week! #1 goes live today - Well, much later today. Today marks our fourth week on the 'Saturday' schedule. It also marks the first addition beyond 'update the website.' Now we're publishing weekly music posts. I should consider 'writing days' or something mid-week just to ensure that keeps going. Everything would still be published on Saturday, but ready by a certain day. Maybe Wednesday or Thursday for Sound of the Week. Or if we can really write one post a day, maybe we should just get that started.</p>
					<p>We'd have a huge backlog of weekly posts. Or, maybe Sound of the Week is something that should just be written when it needs to be. That is, when I feel like it. As long as there is something for Saturday, it's okay. But I'm going to set a personal goal of writing & finishing one post a day till I build up a decent backlog. Either way, I think relaxing on trying to make everything perfect is helping me out. The original first 'Sound of the Week' post was supposed to go out last week (8th) but it just wasn't gonna happen.</p>

					<h3>Sound of the Week! #1 Thoughts</h3>
					<p>Hi. So, I just wrote the first 'Sound of the Week!' post. Well, first to be published. I've written around five drafts now. None of them feel right. So I just wrote the first thing that came to mind, and that was The The's song 'Slow Emotion Replay.' It's a very short post, very casual. I don't know if its any good - or valuable in any way whatsoever. But if we publish it on publication Saturday (15th), it should give us some momentum. The way I see it is as a juggling act. We can gradually start juggling more & more - adding more to the schedule until it's a full-blown show.</p>
					<p>We started with weekly website updates (Saturday). Now it's time to add 'Sound of the Week!' posts. I've been wanting to write about music in some way since 2022, so this is long overdue. No more waiting. I think earlier entries were trying to keep up some persona of a 'show-like' thing. But it's much easier and more geniune if we just stay honest. At the same time, I don't want to be completely lazy about it. So once again, as with everything, it's a balancing act. A juggling act.</p>
					<p>Something I need to say - while I'm here - is this: I write creative pieces and I write journal entries. I write articles. I write articles about my open-source coding projects. I am a writer and a coder. I am passionate about music. At the start of this year, I published many old coding projects into the public domain via GitHub and published my brief poems and other creative writing onto my GitHub Pages website.</p>
					<p>Just felt like I needed to clarify what I'm doing here. I am documenting parts of my life on the internet through my work. I am taking extracts from my personal journal entries to use as 'content' for my website. I am learning to be as transparent as possible through my writing. That's my purpose right now.</p>
					<p>I'm just stating my goals.</p>
					<p>I've recognized that the longer I try to perfect something without sharing it, the worse it gets.</p>
					<p>And yet, in the back of my mind: Why am I doing any of this? It's obvious that the quaity is not there.</p>
					<p>But the passion absolutely is, which outweighs everything.</p>
					<p>That constant doubt of everything slows it all down. It's simply a case of just continuing to do it, regardless of what that side of me and anybody else thinks. Don't forget that. Ultimately, I'm just glad that whatever has shifted since the end of last year has allowed you to start sharing things again, and creating things. Because that's the most important thing to you. You just need to share things. I've probably said all this a mallion times before. Anyway, goodnight.</p>

							<h4>bandcamp vs soundcloud</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							Hi. So I set up Bandcamp <a href="../../changelog/20250218/index.html">yesterday</a>. I was going to put more things on it today, now it's gone. Deleted. For some reason. I have no idea why. Maybe I violated TOS by uploading such bad 'music' on there. I don't know. I only put one thing on there and now the page is just... gone. And I can't login. So that's a shame. I guess I'll have to try making a new account, see what happens to that one, and then try out Soundcloud if it happens again.
						</p>
						<p>Just searched to see if anybody else has had this issue, seems like there are lot of posts about the same thing. And Bandcamp didn't respond to their e-mails. So that's encouraging.</p>
						<p>I tried to make a new account - it just says "Unknown error" under the password form. Even tried another e-mail address. Guess I'll try Soundcloud instead.</p>
						<p>Okay, so we have: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/">https://soundcloud.com/fishercallum/</a></p>
						<p>It's just for testing.</p>
