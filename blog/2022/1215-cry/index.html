					<h1>Cry</h1>
					<p>
						Were you born to make me cry<br>
						Hurt me, hurt me all the time<br>
						I trusted you but you let me down<br>
						In my sorrows I could drown
					</p>
					<p>
						You might as well just leave<br>
						You've got too many tricks up your sleeve<br>
						So why don't you go, there's the door<br>
						We don't want you here any more
					</p>
					<p>
						We've seen enough of your kind<br>
						Now all we want is peace of mind<br>
						Our people do not think like you<br>
						We have gained a wider view
					</p>
					<p>
						You will not listen, nor will we<br>
						This scrap could go on endlessly
					</p>
