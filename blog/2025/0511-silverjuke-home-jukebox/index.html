					<h1>Building the Ultimate Home Jukebox With Silverjuke</h1>
					<h2>What I Want</h2>
					<p>I've always loved the idea of replicating the jukebox experience at home, but with full control over the music. No subscriptions, no lockouts, no file format restrictions. Just a machine that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stores my entire music library (MP3s, FLACs, etc.)</li>
						<li>Lets guests easily browse and queue songs</li>
						<li>Works with a touchscreen for ease of use</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>How I Got It</h2>
					<p>The project kicked off when I found a Lenovo IdeaCenter all-in-one PC (circa 2010) at a charity shop for £30.</p>
					<p>It has a glass touchscreen and acts as a fully self-contained computer.</p>
					<p>The IdeaCenter came with Windows 7, which I replaced with a clean Windows 10 install.</p>
					<p>After some tinkering, I eventually installed a piece of multi-media software called Kodi, hoping to set up a jukebox-like experience with a queue. </p>
					<p>Unfortunately, after tinkering with some of Kodi's plugins and digging through its settings, I wasn't able to set it up in a way that resembled the jukebox experiences I'm so fond of.</p>
					<p>It was clear that I would need a more specialised jukebox software solution.</p>
					<h2>Silverjuke</h2>
					<p>After some searching, and lots of trial & error with various pieces of outdated, unsupported software, I had finally found my solution: <b>Silverjuke</b>. Silverjuke is a great piece of jukebox software that offers many customisation options.</p>
					<p>Here's what makes it great:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It plays all of my music, including my MP3 and FLAC formatted files.</li>
						<li>It offers a background music function, ensuring there's always something playing.</li>
						<li>I can limit how often songs can be repeated, and even how many songs can be queued at a time.</li>
						<li>Lastly, Silverjuke has a fully reskinnable interface, meaning its look can be adjusted to your preference. I personally use its built-in classic jukebox style.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>More than that, Silverjuke is completely open-source, meaning anybody has the opportunity to contribute to the project. Additionally, Silverjuke doesn't require any activation servers to work, or a regular payment to continue to operate. Once activated (via an offline code), it just works.</p>
					<p>The open-source version is available for free on Linux if you're savvy enough to put it together, but I opted for the one-time payment for a Windows copy of the software. An activation key was e-mailed to me, which I can use at any time, online or offline, to activate the software.</p>
					<h2>The Final Product</h2>
					<p>Overall, despite some minor drawbacks (E.G. guests having to double-press songs to play them), Silverjuke seems to be just about a perfect solution for a long-lasting jukebox experience at home, and it keeps you in control.</p>
					<p>The customisation on offer is really impressive and I've barely scratched the surface with what it can do. That said, there are a few more features worth highlighting:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Cross-fading</b>: Silverjuke has a great adjustable cross-fading option, allowing songs to gradually fade into each other.</li>
						<li><b>Visualizers</b>: There is a huge variety of visualizer options available for your music, and you can adjust the idle time after which they display. These add a visual liveliness alongside the music.</li>
						<li><b>Karaoke</b>: Even if it's not your thing, Silverjuke is capable of displaying song lyrics in the form of <b>LRC</b> files, which can be easily sourced online. Just drop the file in the same place as a song, and ensure both have the same file name. Silverjuke cam automatically display those lyrics when that song is playing.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Conveniently, the computer I'm using has a ridge towards the bottom of the screen, serving as a perfect place to put a small USB-powered light bar. I angled the light towards the computer's front-facing buttons, which run along a thin silver strip. As the light bar reacts to noise, light shines down and reflects in an effective display of colour.</p>
					<p>I stuck an additional light bar on the back of the machine, which brightly illuminates any surface it happens to be up against.</p>
					<h2>Tips</h2>
					<p>If you plan on making your own home jukebox running Silverjuke, I suggest looking into a couple of things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Running Silverjuke on start-up</b>: I set my Windows 10 install to be passwordless, so it logs in automatically. Next, I set a simple <b>batch script</b> to run on startup to continuously start and restart Silverjuke in its fullscreen <b>kiosk mode</b>. This ensures that the program will quickly recover, should it crash for any reason. (I haven't experienced any crashes yet.)</li>
						<li><b>Reducing the screen resolution</b>: If you find that buttons are too small and easy to miss, I suggest going into your device's display settings and reducing its resolution. Silverjuke's buttons should appear much larger and be easier to press.</li>
						<li><b>Change the skin!</b> Silverjuke offers a few default looks, so try out different ones to see what fits best. I personally prefer the classic jukebox skin.</li>	
					</ul>
