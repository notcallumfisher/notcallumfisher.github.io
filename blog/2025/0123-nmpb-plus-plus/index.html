						<h1>NMPB++ for Multiplayer Piano: A Node.js MIDI player bot</h1>
						<p>
							NMPB++ was a Node.js MIDI player bot for <a href="https://multiplayerpiano.net/">Multiplayer Piano</a> created in 2018, inspired by Ste-Art's MIDI player bot (NMPB).
							It was able to connect clients via proxies and split MIDI notes between them to bypass the website's note limit.
						</p>
						<p>
							It featured a web controller of some description, which might've been my first time trying to create a hand-coded website.
							After being recovered from a CD-RW on the 8th of December 2023, it's <a href="https://github.com/cffisher/EpicOS/tree/main/extras/2018-nmpb-plus-plus">published on GitHub</a> in all its tacked-together glory for archival purposes.</p>
						<!--<p>
							NMPB++ started off as a bot that simply split the notes of the original NMPB (running in a private channel) into separate clients.
							It later evolved into a stand-alone Node.js MIDI bot using midi-player-js.

						<p>The web controller used <a href="https://socket.io/">socket.io</a> to communicate with its server. It featured a live chat feed from Multiplayer Piano and provided options for setting note echo effects, playing or pausing MIDI files and moving the bot to other rooms.</p>
						<p>This very 90s looking web controller reflects one of my first attempts at creating any kind of webpage. Prior to this, my only experience had been using <a href="https://wix.com/">Wix, a free website builder</a> to make a fan website about Five Nights at Freddy's... As you can see, I was a fan of text shadows and gradients.</p>
