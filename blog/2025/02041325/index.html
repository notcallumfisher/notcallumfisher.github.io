					<p>Wondering if so many pages for such short entries is a good idea.</p>
					<p>Current website structure is something like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>/a/ (assets)</li>
						<li>/a/js/</li>
						<li>/a/css/</li>
						<li>/a/img/</li>
					</ul>
					<ul><li>/index.html (Directory - index.html - Featured in Tech with 4 posts from /t/, Featured in Writing with 4 posts from /w/, etc. Both have 'See more on [Topic]' buttons linking to their respective indexes)</li></ul>
					<ul>
						<li>/w/ (writing)</li>
						<li>/w/index.html (index last four poems/entries, and 'All' writing below that)</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>/t/ (tech)</li>
						<li>/t/index.html (index last four tech posts and 'All' writing below that, and below that original code 'Projects' section/timeline by year)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						To complement this, I could create a singular 'index-all.html' or something for a category.
						For example, /w/ could have <b>index-all.html</b> that contains the full content of every entry on one page.
						Duplicating the content to offer more viewing options. I don't know. some entries feel too short to warrant their own pages</p>
					</p>
					<p>So it be could be:</p>
					<p><b>2025.02.04</b></p>
					<p>
						my shoes are supersized<br>
						love defies, love defies gravity
					</p>
					<p><b>2025.02.03</b></p>
					<p>
						my life is upside down<br>
						i'm walking around town on my own again<br>
						alone again
					</p>
					<p>etc.</p>
					<p>
						I could just delete the separate pages and change the /w/index.html hrefs to #tags in writing-all.html ?
						That way I don't have to worry about future maintenance on a billion different writing pages. Tech is out of the question for now.
					</p>
					<p>
						Probably will do something like #20250128 or #20250128-museum if there are multiple entries from the same day, to differentiate them.
						I'm not sure if I should always include the name or only when the entries need to be clearly differentiated. #20250128 for brevity in most cases.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>/w/all#20250128</li>
						<li>/w/all#20250128-electronic-egg-timer</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I like that. This is way better, I don't know why I didn't do that in the first place. But here we are.
						I should find a way to make headers clickable, copyable, easily sharable. Click "2025.01.01: Dusty Dave", copy "/w/all#20250101". That's the way to do it.
						These tags are a lifesaver.
