					<p>at this point, i'm so deep in it, the organisational side of things, that it pains me to say this: i need to dump everything into the blog if anything is to move forward</p>
					<p>that's to say notes need to be "blog". there can't be any separation. just 1 channel, one outlet for everything.</p>
					<p>that's the only way things are going to be good</p>
					<p>oh but then do we put the writing in there</p>
					<p>...........................</p>
					<p>sure, but then i'd frame the writing index as a 'blog collection', a collection of blog entries relating to a specific category</p>
					<p>the only thing that bothers me is titles. i'm already having to add dates after 'website progress' entries, otherwise they're all identical. but i don't necessarily want every page to have a date, so now there's no standard</p>
					<p>now some pages have dates and some don't</p>
					<p>does it really matter? i doubt it</p>
