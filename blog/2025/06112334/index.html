					<p>i just realized, or re-realized that i have a staggering amount of journal entries to go into the blog.</p>
					<p>any worries about lack of content can be safely ignored.</p>
					<p>& i don't care</p>
					<p>there is plenty of text to go around</p>
					<p>wrap the moon up in this stuff</p>
					<p>i feel like everything has slipped back into place again. i wasn't 100% happy with the titles on those blog entries, because every entry had a title that could potentially be a duplicate, and didn't have any other unique identifier in the title. that was until i realized the obvious: i don't need to have titles. titles are absolutely not a requirement.</p>
					<p>just going for dates when appropriate, titles when appropriate. now we don't need to title every little thought. seems like a huge relief</p>
