					<h1>Hello, Blog</h1>
					<h2>The Problem</h2>
					<p>I've been thinking about managing this website long-term, and I've figured that sharing everything is not the way I want to handle it.</p>
					<p>
						As it stands, the website is full of my personal notes, questionable attempts at poetry, project retrospectives and some article attempts. Writing is split into separate categories like tech, poetry, notes and sound.
					</p>
					<p>The issue is that the website has become a dumping ground for just about anything I can spit out, which isn't what I intended.</p>
					<p>
						Of all these things, the page that best reflects what I had intended this website to be is the <a href="../../2022/0412-crystal-fm/index.html">retrospective post on Crystal FM, a music bot I coded for Discord</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'd like to lean into the coding retrospective posts more. In these posts, I would offer some thoughts on what I could've done better, what I thought went well and how I made certain choices.
					</p>
					<h2>The Plan</h2>
					<p>So, here's my plan for this website - and yes, it does mean another restructuring:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Shift all existing content into a temporary directory I can pull ideas from</li>
						<li>Drop current categories (like sound, tech and writing)</li>
						<li>Create a single 'blog' directory that contains all entries</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Scheduling</h2>
					<p>Regarding a schedule...</p>
					<p>Since the 'Sound of the Week' Saturday schedule crashed, I won't worry about publishing a specific post on Saturdays. I'll just focus on publishing any kind of post. It could be anything from a coding retrospective to a new project, or a playlist of songs I like.</p>
					<p>Ideally, there'll always something to post on a Saturday. There will be missed days, naturally, but it won't matter so much. I'm hoping to make this something I can easily drop and pick up later.</p>
					<p>I already have lots of ideas, and lots of drafts I can dust off and shape into posts.</p>
					<p>Overall, this should mean less time wasted on categorisation, and more time spent on <i>actually</i> writing.</p>
					<p>So, let's get started...</p>
