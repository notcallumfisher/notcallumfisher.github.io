					<p>i want to talk about music somehow on my website. i have a music section set up, but no content on it yet. should i start with brief weekly features of songs i like? briefly interpreting their lyrics, how i discovered the song, how it makes me feel, etc.? eventually i'd like to do full artist catalogues talking about every song and album, maybe i could do weekly/bi-weekly album reviews in the future?</p>
					<p>I have hundreds and hundreds of songs noted down on my computer, I'd love to revisit and talk about all of them eventually. I'm planning to start with weekly, brief 'Song of the Week' posts. Maybe I'll aim to have a 'Songs of The Week' completed for every Saturday. I've managed to write in this journal every day of the month except for two days so far. I've largely stuck to my word. Hopefully I can take that into this weekly song project.</p>
					<p>This is still something for the future though, the website structure is still being finalized - although very, very nearly done.</p>
					<p>How should I title weekly song posts?</p>
