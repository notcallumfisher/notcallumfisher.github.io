					<h1>Sound of the Week! #2</h1>
					<h2>The Dramatics - In The Rain, Electric Light Orchestra</h2>
					<p>Hello! Welcome to the second Sound of the Week. This week, I want to share with you The Dramatics' song 'In The Rain.' The atmosphere in this song is incredible - well, it's all in the name really: 'The Dramatics.' I have a high appreciation for songs that go beyond instruments to incorporate various sound effects like this one. These are the kinds of songs that - in my opinion - you really have to close your eyes and listen to. Even once. It's a vastly different experience than just putting it on in the background while you do other things.</p>
					<p>When you dedicate yourself entirely to listening, you become immersed in your own vision of the song, making the experience far more meaningful. The sound effects play a huge role in keeping you there, anchoring you in the world the song creates. Many tracks achieve this kind of world-building through sound effects. One that comes to mind is Electric Light Orchestra's 'Standing in the Rain' - which I suppose you could pair up nicely with this song.</p>
					<p>ELO does a lot of that sort of thing in their music. Take 'Ticket to the Moon' from their must-listen album Time, for example. At the end of the song, you hear something like a train announcer, lots of busy people. These kinds of things add a visual element just through sound, which is naturally easier to focus on when you're - well, focusing on it. It's like discovering a part of the song that's really hidden in plain sight.</p>
					<p>So, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tc8mVX6-bY">In The Rain by The Dramatics</a> is one to focus on.</p>
