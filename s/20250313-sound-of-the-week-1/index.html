					<h1><i>Sound of the Week! #1</i></h1>
					<h2>The The - Slow Emotion Replay</h2>
					<p>Hi all. Featured this week: The The's - <i>Yes, <b>The The</b></i> - 's song 'Slow Emotion Replay.' A great song.</p>
					<p><q>Everybody knows what's going on in the world / but I don't even know what's going on in myself.</q></p>
					<p>Aside from the song, I love the music video produced for it.</p>
					<p>The music video bravely opens with a four minute interview clip before any music actually plays, but it sets the tone incredibly well, with an interviewer asking a man in a bar <q>What are the problems in the world today?</q></p>
					<p>Ultimately - after being repeatedly asked - he tears up and says <q>Many, many that I cannot solve. Sickness, the idea that we cannot get along. I don't know who to attribute this to, but... And I do not have the answer.</q></p>
					<p>Then the song comes in with its opening line: <q>The more I see, the less I know about all the things I thought were wrong or right and carved and stone.</q></p>
					<p>I love that opening. Those few minutes really capture just how crushing the weight of the 'world's problems' can be on somebody.</p>
					<p>The reality is that most of us don't have the answers.</p>
					<p>I see this song as a reminder that you don't need to carry the weight of the world's problems.</p>
					<p>This is one timeless song that speaks to the disillusionment paired with getting caught up in problems that are beyond our scope - something I think we can all relate to. If you aren't already familiar with <i>The The</i> and songs like <b>Slow Emotion Replay</b>, now's the time to get started.</p>
					<p>You can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7ZZVJ120A4">listen to the song on YouTube</a>.</p>
